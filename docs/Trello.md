Trello card linking support
===========================

**DEPRECATED**: this feature has been deprecated and is not guaranteed to work.

Simply link the card shortcut under each item using `tr/XXXX`, where *XXXX* is 
the short URL ID for the Trello card. You can see the short ID in Trello by 
clicking "more..." inside the card popup.

    Beta release:
      - Blog @tr/Xh3pAGp1
      - Account management

You can also link the card numbers, but you have to define the main Trello board 
URL. Simply add `Trello URL: ____` to the top of the file.
